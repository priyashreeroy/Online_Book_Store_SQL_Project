# 🛒 Online Book Store – SQL Project

This project is a simple SQL-based database system designed to manage an **online bookstore**.  
It demonstrates how SQL can be used to handle books, customers, and orders — along with useful data analysis queries.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

The project includes three main tables:
- **Books** – stores information like title, author, genre, price, stock, and published year.
- **Customers** – stores customer details such as name, city, and country.
- **Orders** – records order details including customer ID, book ID, quantity, date, and total amount.

The SQL queries in this file help retrieve and analyze data from these tables.
